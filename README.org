#+title: Self Repaying ETH
#+author: Wary

The =Self Repaying ETH= contract is a smart contract helper which simplifies the borrowing of =ETH= debt with =Alchemix= 🧙‍🪄💸. It mints =ETH= debt (i.e. =alETH=) from an =Alchemix= account and exchange it for =ETH= using =Curve=.


* 🌍 Overview

The =Self Repaying ETH= is a smart contract written in Solidity that uses:
- the [[https://alchemix.fi/][Alchemix Protocol]] to manage users self repaying debt
- the [[https://curve.fi][Curve Protocol]] to exchange =alETH= for =ETH=


* 🧐 How to use

** To use the =Self Repaying ETH= feature in your smart contract, you need to:
- Make your SC inherit the =SelfRepayingETH= (aka =sreth=) contract
- Borrow some =Self Repaying ETH= from an =Alchemix= account by calling =_borrowSelfRepayingETHFrom(<your address>, <amount>)=. It mints =alETH= debt to your SC and exchange it for =ETH= using the =Curve= exchange

** To use your SC, your users need to:
- Deposit enough =ETH= funds to the =alETH AlchemistV2= contract
- Allow the your contract to mint enough =alETH= debt to cover future borrows by calling =alchemistV2.approveMint(<your contract>, <amount>)=
